If wanting to add a new translation, follow these instructions:

1. Set up [development environment](#development)

2. Add language to `LANGS.md`

3. Copy the the `en` directory and rename it with the 2 letter language code of the language you're translating to (e.g. `zh`)

4. Translate content

5. Set `"root"` to `"./"` in `book.json` if not already set
